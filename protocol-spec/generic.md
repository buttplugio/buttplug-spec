**Message Version:** 0

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device to stop.

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.

```json
[
  {
    "StopDeviceCmd": {
      "Id": 1,
      "DeviceIndex": 0

```

## StopAllDevices

**Description:** Sent by the client to tell the server to stop all devices. Can be used for emergency situations, on client shutdown for cleanup, etcâ€¦ While this is considered a Device Message, since it pertains to all currently connected devices, it does not specify a device index \(and does not end with 'Cmd'\).

**Introduced In Version:** 0

**Message Version:** 0

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.
* Error message on value or message error.

  {
    "StopAllDevices": {
      "Id": 1
    }
  }

```

## RawCmd

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device
* _Command_ \(Array of bytes\): Command to send, array of ints with a range of \[0-255\]. Minimum length is 1.

    }
  }
]
```

## SingleMotorVibrateCmd

**Deprecated:** This message has been superseded by [VibrateCmd](generic.md#vibratecmd)

**Description:** Causes a toy that supports vibration to run all vibration motors at a certain speed. In order to abstract the dynamic range of different toys, the value sent is a float with a range of \[0.0-1.0\]

**Introduced In Version:** 0

**Message Version:** 0

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device
* _Speed_ \(float\): Vibration speed

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.
* Error message on value or message error.

**Flow Diagram:**

**Serialization Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "SingleMotorVibrateCmd": {
      "Id": 1,
      "DeviceIndex": 0,
      "Speed": 0.5
    }
  }
]
```

## VibrateCmd

**Description:** Causes a toy that supports vibration to run specific vibration motors at a certain speeds. Devices with multiple vibrator features may take multiple values. The [FeatureCount](enumeration.md#messageattributes) attribute for the message in the [DeviceList](enumeration.md#devicelist)/[DeviceAdded](enumeration.md#deviceadded) message will contain that information.

Since devices may differ in terms of range of vibration strengths, the values are sent as a dictionary of vibration motor indexes against floats with a range of \[0.0-1.0\] wihich will be scaled appropriately for the device.

**Introduced In Version:** 1

**Message Version:** 1

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device
* _Speeds_ \(array\): Vibration speeds
  * _Index_ \(unsigned int\): Index of vibration motor
  * _Speed_ \(double\): Vibration speed with a range of \[0.0-1.0\]

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.
* Error message on value or message error.

**Serialization Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "VibrateCmd": {
      "Id": 1,
      "DeviceIndex": 0,
      "Speeds": [
        {
          "Index": 0,
          "Speed": 0.5
        },
        {
          "Index": 1,
          "Speed": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## LinearCmd

**Description:** Causes a toy that supports linear movement to move to a position over a certain amount of time. Devices with multiple linear actuator features may take multiple values. The [FeatureCount](enumeration.md#messageattributes) attribute for the message in the [DeviceList](enumeration.md#devicelist)/[DeviceAdded](enumeration.md#deviceadded) message will contain that information.

In order to abstract the dynamic ranges (both speed and movement) of different toys, the values are sent as a dictionary of linear actuator indexes against objects encapsulating floats with a range of \[0.0-1.0\] for speed and position.

**Introduced In Version:** 1

**Message Version:** 1

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device
* _Vectors_ \(array\): Linear actuator speeds and positions
  * _Index_ \(unsigned int\): Index of linear actuator
  * _Time_ \(unsigned int\): Movement time in milliseconds
  * _Position_ \(double\): Target position with a range of \[0.0-1.0\]

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.
* Error message on value or message error.


**Serialization Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "LinearCmd": {
      "Id": 1,
      "DeviceIndex": 0,
      "Vectors": [
        {
          "Index": 0,
          "Speed": 0.5,
          "Position": 0.3
        },
        {
          "Index": 1,
          "Speed": 1,
          "Posiion": 0.8
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

## RotateCmd

**Description:** Causes a toy that supports rotation to rotate at a certain speeds in specified directions. Devices with multiple rotating features may have multiple values. The [FeatureCount](enumeration.md#messageattributes) attribute for the message in the [DeviceList](enumeration.md#devicelist)/[DeviceAdded](enumeration.md#deviceadded) message will have this information.

In order to abstract the dynamic range of different toys, the values are sent as a dictionary of rotation motor indexes against objects encapsulating the speed as a float with a range of \[0.0-1.0\] and the direction as a boolean (true being clockwise). **Note:** clockwise may be subjective.

**Introduced In Version:** 1

**Message Version:** 1

**Fields:**

* _Id_ \(unsigned int\): Message Id
* _DeviceIndex_ \(unsigned int\): Index of device
* _Speeds_ \(array\): Rotation speeds
  * _Index_ \(unsigned int\): Index of rotation motor
  * _Speed_ \(double\): Rotation speed with a range of \[0.0-1.0\]
  * _Clockwise_ \(boolean\): Direction of rotation \(clockwise may be subjective\)

**Expected Response:**

* Ok message with matching Id on successful request.
* Error message on value or message error.

**Serialization Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "RotationCmd": {
      "Id": 1,
      "DeviceIndex": 0,
      "Speeds": [
        {
          "Index": 0,
          "Speed": 0.5,
          "Clockwise": true
        },
        {
          "Index": 1,
          "Speed": 1,
          "Clockwise": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
