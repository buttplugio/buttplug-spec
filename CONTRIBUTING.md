# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Metafetish
Organization repo! We're looking forward to working with you to make
this project better.

## Code Of Conduct

First off, you'll want to check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which
should be alongside this document. It outlines the rules and
expectations for interaction with our project.

## Communication

There are a couple of different ways in which you can interact with
other members of Metafetish projects.

- [We have a Slack instance](https://metafetish.slack.com). Note that an invitation is required
  to join the slack instance. Please email admin@metafetish.com for an
  invite, and include the email address you'd like to use to log in.
- [We have message boards](http://metafetish.club). We have Discourse forums available that
  cover most of our projects. For anything that doesn't fit into one
  of the categories, there's the General forum.

## Getting up and running on a project

In many cases, if you are trying to start developing a new project,
information about compiling and using the project will be in the
README. If these instructions are missing or incomplete, you can ask
in the [proper category on the message boards](http://metafetish.club), or file an issue on
the project if you have a github account. You can also contact us on
Slack if you have an account there.

Note that some of our projects are rather complicated, and span
multiple repositories and/or technologies. We do our best to keep
things up to date, but there may be times where we've missed updating
documentation. If something seems wrong, or isn't working for you, ask
us using one of the above methods.

## Filing feature requests

If there are features you'd like in a project, you may request them by:

- If you have a github account, filing a github issue on the project.
- Otherwise, make a post on the message board in the appropriate
  category, or on the General category if a proper category does not
  exist.
  
Please be specific in your feature request. We will ask followup
questions for clarification, but the more information we have, the
better.

## Filing bug reports

If you find a problem in a project, please do not hesitate to tell us.

- If you have a github account, filing a github issue on the project.
- Otherwise, make a post on the message board in the appropriate
  category, or on the General category if a proper category does not
  exist.

In the issue or post, you should let us know:

- The software you are using that has the bug
- The version of the software
- The operating system version of the computer you using the software
  on.
- The steps you took to get to the problem.
- Whether the problem is repeatable.

Someone should hopefully follow up on your problem soon.
