## Introduction

This repo houses specifications documents for the Buttplug Intimate
Hardware Control Server Protocol (referred to hereafter as Buttplug).

Buttplug aims to simplify accessing and controlling different kinds of
intimate hardware such as vibrators, strokers, and machines, as well
as other devices like kegelcizers, electrostimulation systems, and
whatever else seems like it could be intimate. The goal is to abstract
line level (usb/bluetooth/serial/etc) protocol knowledge away from the
developer, so they can concentrate on creating new and interesting
interfaces, applications, games, and other software.

HTML rendered version of the Protocol Spec is at
[https://buttplug-spec.docs.buttplug.io/](https://buttplug-spec.docs.buttplug.io/).

More information on the Buttplug project can be found at at
[https://buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io).

## Talk To Us!

If you're interested in Buttplug Development, check out our [discord server](https://discord.buttplug.io)!

There's also a message board for development and support at [metafetish.club](https://metafetish.club).

## Building The Protocol Documents

To build this document into HTML pages or pdfs, you'll need to use
[vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). We have a node package file
available to install the version we use for development and build the
book. Use the following commands to set it up.

```
npm install
npm run build
```

To see a local version of the protocol docs:

```
npm run dev
```
